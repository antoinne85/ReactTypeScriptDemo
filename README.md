# ReactTypeScriptDemo
A (close to) minimal React &amp; TypeScript Application

If you're looking to get up and running with React and TypeScript as fast as possible, simply checkout this repository, copy the files wherever you need them, then "Add Existing Project" in Visual Studio.

If you want to change the name of the project (I know I would), simply rename the .csproj file and edit the content of the <RootNamespace> element inside of the .csproj file. (Be sure to do this before adding the project to your solution, just to save some hassle.)
